 * The java15 class prints the current date and time.
 */
import java.util.Date;
public class java15 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date foo = new Date();
        String x=foo.toString();
        System.out.println(x);
        
    }
}

The code is trying to print the date in a string.
The code is using the class Date and then creating an instance of it with new.
Then, it prints out the string representation of that object's value by calling its toString method.
The main function creates a new Date object and assigns it to variable foo.
It then uses String's constructor call x=foo.toString() which will create a String from the value of this newly created Date object, which is what we want to print on screen for debugging purposes.
The code will print the following: Fri Jun 13 16:07:39 EDT 2017
